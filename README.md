- 👋 Hi, I’m @GrandLamia

I lost access to the email host that I used on my other account. Specifically somebody 
else bought the domain name. This account is using Gmail--which well, if I lose access to
that... well then

- 👀 I’m interested in ...

I've learned to not like things. Liking things leads to people learning I enjoy stuff
Which leads to my enjoyments being twisted against me

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

Everything! I want to know all the things! But... I will work on figuring out how to prioritise
things that are best able to be learned at the moment 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...

Stuff I'm actually able to collaborate on

- 📫 How to reach me ...

We live in a trash heap. Social Media is a toxic mess--and other forms of contact have been
taken out by how much everything sucks. This would need to be fixed
